<p>To help first-time home buyers in Canada achieve their goal of owning a home, the federal government has introduced First-time Home Buyers Incentive (FTHBI). FTHBI acknowledges the affordability issue faced by many young Canadians and demonstrates the government’s commitment to making housing affordable to those looking to buy their first home.</p>

<p>The First-time Home Buyers Incentive is a government program that provides an interest-free loan of five percent of the purchase price of an existing home and up to ten percent for a new home, including pre-construction. The loan works like an equity where the government shares some ownership of homes purchased through the program. So if you get ten percent of your home price covered by FTHBI, you would own ninety percent of it while the government owns the remaining ten percent. This is perfect for end users (those who buy a home to live in it) who can take out a smaller mortgage and keep their monthly payments lower.</p>

<p>The loan must be paid back if the home gets sold or in 25 years, and it can be paid back any time. Because it’s an equity loan, the government shares the ups and downs of the home price.
House value is one thing, but another important thing to note is how much impact this is going to have on making mortgage payments, which cuts into other consumer spending such as food, transportation and entertainment.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-qualify-for-first-time-home-buyers-incentive">Do I qualify for First-time Home Buyers Incentive?</h2>

<p>Here are the requirements for you to qualify for FTHBI. First, buyers must have a household income below $120,000 per year. The amount of the insured mortgage plus the incentive would be capped at four times the homebuyer’s annual income and up to $480,000. That means the most expensive home you can buy under the plan would be worth somewhere between $480,000 and $533,000, depending on the size of your down payment.
And, as the name of the program suggests, this program is available to those buying their first home.
The government has allocated $1.25 billion over the next three years for FTHBI. The incentive is handed out on a first come, first served basis. So if you want to checkif you’re eligible and you’re ready to own your home, send us a message using the form below.</p>

<h2 id="first-time-home-buyer-incentive-summary">First-time Home Buyer Incentive Summary</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The borrower must be either a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or a non-permanent resident who is legally authorized to work in Canada</li>
  <li>Your maximum qualifying income must be less than $120,000</li>
  <li>You must be a first-time homebuyer, as per the definition below</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="whos-a-first-time-homebuyer">Who’s a first-time homebuyer?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>You have never purchased a home (if multiple people are buying the house together, at least one person must never have purchased a home)</li>
  <li>You have gone through a breakdown of a marriage or common-law partnership</li>
  <li>In the last 4 years, you did not occupy a home that you or you current spouse or common-law partner owned</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="should-i-apply-for-first-time-home-buyer-incentive">Should I apply for First-time Home Buyer Incentive?</h2>
<p>You should take advantage of this program, if you meet the eligibility and if you’re looking to buy a home that’s less than $533,000. Under the program, the amount of down payment you can make is capped at 19.99% (the mortgage needs to be uninsured). This means that if you (and your spouse if you’re married) are earning the maximum qualifying income of $120,000, $480,000 is the most you can get for a mortgage and the incentive. And since this amount can only cover up to 90.01% of the home value, the remaining down payment amount (can only be up to 9.99% of home value) determines what you can buy.</p>

<p>If the price of the home that you want to buy is more than $533,000, then maybe it’s better for you to just skip the incentive and use your own money and more mortgage to buy that home. Remember, the program is designed to help people buy a home they want to live in. So if your dream home is outside of the FTHBI boundary AND you can still afford it, it would be better for you to buy it without getting the incentive.</p>

<h2 id="when-can-i-start-taking-advantage-of-first-time-home-buyer-incentive">When can I start taking advantage of First-time Home Buyer Incentive?</h2>

<p>The government has announced that the program will launch on September 2, 2019.

<h3 id="who-qualifies-for-fthbi">Who qualifies for FTHBI?</h3>

<p>In order for you to be qualified for FTHBI, you must satisfy all of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You must be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or a non-permanent resident who is legally authorized to work in Canada</li>
  <li>You have never purchased a home (either as an investment or to live in it)</li>
  <li>If you have purchased a home to live in it, it was 4 years ago</li>
  <li>You have recently gone through a breakdown of a marriage or common-law partnership. In this case, you are still eligible even if you don’t meet other requirements</li>
</ol>

<p>Another very important point is that you cannot use FTHBI to buy an investment property. That means, once the home is ready to be occupied, it is you and your spouse who move in to live in it.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-calculate-the-maximum-price-i-can-get-with-fthbi">How do I calculate the maximum price I can get with FTHBI?</h3>

<p>The home you can afford is largely dependent on two factors: you and your spouse’s combined income and down payment size. Your mortgage + incentive is 4 times the combined income. This amount covers between 85.01% to 90.01% of the home price depending on whether you’re buying an existing home or a new home. This means that you’re responsible for either 14.99% (existing home) or 9.99% (new home) remaining down payment.</p>

<p>So here are two quick formulas you can use to calculate the maximum price you can afford:</p>

<h4 id="existing-home-add-the-formula-in-image">Existing home: <em>&lt;ADD THE FORMULA IN IMAGE&gt;</em></h4>
<h4 id="new-home-add-the-formula-in-image">New home: <em>&lt;ADD THE FORMULA IN IMAGE&gt;</em></h4>

<p>[TABLE]</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-apply-for-fthbi">How do I apply for FTHBI?</h3>
<p>Once you check your eligibility and find the place to call home, you submit your mortgage application to the lender. The lender will work with mortgage insurers and the solicitor to get an approval for the FTHBI application and take care of other details.</p>

<p>The <em>&lt;NAME&gt;</em> team can guide you through this process. Contact us using the form below.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-terms-of-the-repayment">What are the terms of the repayment?</h3>
<p>The incentive you get must be paid back when you sell your home or after 25 years, whichever is earliest. The repayment amount depends on the market value of the home. Also, you must repay the full amount in one transfer (no instalments).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-considered-a-new-home-to-be-eligible-for-the-10-incentive">What is considered a new home to be eligible for the 10% incentive?</h3>
<p>Simply put, a new home is a home that no one has ever lived in. This includes those that recently got completed and pre-construction projects that have a longer time horizon.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-stack-this-on-top-of-other-regional-incentives">Can I stack this on top of other regional incentives?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot combine FTHBI with other similar interest-free incentives. The NAME team can help you determine which incentive is best for you based on your target home and situation.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-rent-out-rooms-in-the-home-i-buy-with-the-incentive">Can I rent out rooms in the home I buy with the incentive?</h3>
<p>Yes, but the rental income gets included in the qualifying income, which cannot be more than $120,000. Also, you must occupy one of the units.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-figure-out-what-my-qualifying-income-is">How do I figure out what my qualifying income is?</h3>
<p>What gets included in your qualifying income may differ bank by bank. Contact your bank to find out what they include in your qualifying income.</p>
