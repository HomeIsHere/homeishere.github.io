            <h1>Agent</h1>
            <hr />
            <p><p>When it comes to making a decision as emotionally and financially large as buying a home, it’s crucial to work with an agent who can put your best interest forward while being successful. In a large market such as Toronto, there’s just no shortage of real estate agents. Perhaps you know a family friend, your old acquaintance is a recently accredited agent, or there’s a particular name that you remember from an outdoor banner ad. With so many choices, what can you evaluate even before their work starts?</p>

<h2 id="first-consider-what-you-are-looking-for">First, consider what you are looking for.</h2>

<p>Are you an investor or someone looking to buy their first home? If you’re an investor, your biggest interest would be finding an undiscovered neighbourhood with many underpriced homes that are poised to have large developments in the future.</p>

<p>Let us just put it out there - while we are happy to work with investors who see the value in our data-driven approach, our primary market is those who are looking for a home to live in, especially young first-time home buyers. Our approach means we don’t focus on looking for “underpriced” homes. If there’s a fantastic home in a desirable neighbourhood, the chances are, the price is going to be more or less “fair”.</p>

<h2 id="second-prepare-to-be-patient">Second, prepare to be patient.</h2>

<p>In a market where good homes get bids in just a few hours and get sold in days, this sounds like the last thing you want an agent to do. We don’t mean being slow when it’s time to act; being patient lets you learn more, evaluate more options, and make a level-headed decision. When we find a home that you really like and it hits all the checkboxes, we’ll move fast to give you an edge over other buyers.</p>

<p>For most agents, having a patient approach is not ideal as their income is based on commissions and not hours spent with clients. For a typical agent, selling more expensive homes fast maximizes their income as they can earn a higher commission from the fast-churning list of customers.</p>

<p>However, we’ve laid it out there that we’re going to earn our business helping those taking their time looking for the perfect home that is within their budget. Home buying is an exciting journey and we’re just grateful that you’re letting us hitch a ride!</p>

<h2 id="third-ask-what-services-are-offered-by-the-agent-and-hisher-team">Third, ask what services are offered by the agent and his/her team.</h2>

<p>Home buying is difficult not only because of the amount of money involved but also because of all the moving pieces. You need to worry about getting a lawyer to review the documents, work with a bank to secure a mortgage, check what insurances your home needs and find new utility services.</p>

<p>A good agent will have professionals who can perform these tasks in his team or have strong connections to the people who will take the referral and perform to the highest of their level.</p>

<p>Home is Here is a team that differentiates itself from other agents with its data-driven approach that offers transparent and easy-to-understand insights. We present you with this knowledge while taking into consideration your unique situation so you can make an informed decision that will impact you for many years down the road. On top of that, we’ve worked hard to form a network of professionals ranging from an expert mortgage specialist at a major bank to an internet salesperson who can offer off-the-website deals for your new home.</p>

<p>Check <a href="/en/about/">about us</a> to learn more about the team and see for yourself if we’re the team that you want to work with. Once you’ve made the decision, use the contact us form below to send a message.</p>
