Owning a home has become one of the important life goals in our lives. To find a home that we’re going to be happy living in, there are a few things that we can’t overlook. Depending on your age, income, and lifestyle, what type of home you need, its size and the location will vary. Let’s look at these top consideration points.

## Age

If you are a working adult in your 20s, you are most likely a first-time homebuyer. Buying a home is an exciting journey that’s going to be one of the most expensive purchases we are going to make in our lifetime. To make sure that everything goes smoothly and the only thing standing between you and your dream home is a front door, you need to first check how much money is left in your bank account after you pay for all your necessities such as your phone bill, transportation, dining and clothing. Because most young adults at this point don’t have too much saved compared to other age groups, the paycheques that come in monthly are what you and the bank are going to look at to make sure that you can afford a home.

If you are in your 30s and already own a home, then maybe your plan is to move up to a bigger home to accommodate your growing family. At this point, since you can sell your home to fund a big portion of your next home, you have consider other aspects, mainly related to your family, such as easy transportation options, family-friendly activities, what schools your child can enroll in and the safety of the neighbourhood.

When you are in your 40s or 50s, your goal reverses from what you had when you were in your 30s. If you have a child, it’s likely they’re about to enter post-secondary education and their choice of school may be out of town. So at this point, you might want to consider downsizing to a smaller home near activities that you like. Typically, when one downsizes to a smaller home, there’s a windfall from selling the bigger home. This additional money can be used to purchase a pre-construction so when your child is done with their school, you can let them stay in their newly completed home so they can use the savings to prepare for their first home purchase.

## Income

Income is the single most important thing that the bank will look at when they determine how much mortgage you can get. The income from your job is recurring and the bank can more confidently calculate how much you’re going to have left after you pay for your necessities. So naturally, if your income is quite high, the bank will want to give you more at the best possible rate. As a rule of thumb, your mortgage will be 4 to 5 times your pre-tax income. Your mortgage can cover from 5% to 95% of the home purchase price.

## Your Status in Canada

Your status in Canada is important as it determines if you need to pay the 15% Non-Resident Speculation Tax (NRST) on your home purchase price in the Golden Horseshoe area.

If you are a Canadian citizen, a PR, or you are a spouse of a citizen or PR, a refugee or an Ontario Immigration Nominee, you are exempt from paying NRST. Even if you need to pay NRST now, in certain situations, you are entitled to get the amount reimbursed. You get NRST reimbursed if

1.  you complete a program at a post-secondary institution (minimum 2 years);
2.  you work full-time with a valid work permit for minimum 1 year; **and**
3.  you obtain your PR within 4 years from the time of purchase.

Please note that if you are applying for an NRST reimbursement thanks to your new PR status, you have to apply within 90 days of receiving your PR.
