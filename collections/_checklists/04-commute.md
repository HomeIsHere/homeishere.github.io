Most young professionals desire living close to where they work. This is quite understandable as no one wants to deal with morning and early evening rush hours. And when you’ve had a long day, taking an hour to commute back home is the last thing on your mind. Living close to work not only saves you the hassle of commuting, it also gives you time to do other more fun things – spending time with friends and family, going out for dinner, discovering a new hot spot in the city, or just taking a well-deserved rest at home.

Downtown Toronto just happens to be this place - there are plenty of jobs for everyone, it’s got all the hottest restaurants, bars and clubs opening every weekend, transportation options to out of town are plentiful and all these things are within your reach.

It just comes with one caveat – price tag. Condos in downtown are super expensive to buy, let alone to rent. For young people, they may not be earning enough to cover a downtown lifestyle. And if you’re a person who loves to go camping far away from the city every summer, you might want to hold on to your car. In that case, even if you work downtown, living in a surrounding neighbourhood may be a better option.

So does that mean to save you need to live in neighbourhoods far from downtown? Not necessarily. According to a report by CMHC, the cost of longer commutes can completely offset the savings from living in a more affordable neighbourhood. Take a look at the map below. Assuming that you are commuting to work in Toronto, the commuting cost goes up the farther you move away from the city. For some neighbourhoods, the average mortgage cost and the commuting cost together was higher than what it was for living in Toronto. For example, CMHC points out that living in neighbourhoods such as New Market, Mississauga and Caledon ends up costing more as the lower mortgage carrying cost is offset by a much higher commuting cost. Notably, there are neighbourhoods that retain the overall cost advantage such as Oshawa, Brampton and Milton.

And what does young home buyers prefer? According to the 2014 RBC-Pembina Home Location Preference Survey, respondents under the age of 35 said that they would pay more for a smaller home that is in a location-efficient neighbourhood. For many young home buyers, being where they live is just as important as what home they live in.

Like your peers, you may prefer to live in a location-efficient neighbourhood that’s either in a high-density area such as downtown Toronto or North York or Mississauga that has readily available public transportation. Or, having a bigger living space at less cost is a luxury that you want to have, you can consider developing cities such as Milton or Burlington. Given this spectrum of choices with difficult tradeoffs, you’re surely wondering what choice is best for you.

It’s an important decision to make. Consider all your options and find a home in a neighbourhood that you want to live in. If you need help, we are here to help.
