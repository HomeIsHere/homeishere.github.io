In Canada, the residential building types are largely divided into three categories: condominiums, houses, and townhouses. As a place where you’re going to spend close to half of your life, finding a home and a neighborhood that best match your lifestyle is key to living a happy life. For example, a condo is ideal for couples and singles who are okay with a smaller living space but want a better access to amenities. Let’s look at the pros and cons of each residential type and see which one is right for you.

## Condo

The biggest benefit of living in a condo is convenience. Most condos are located in cities where residents can take short walks to subway/bus stations, gyms, grocery stores and restaurants for nights when you really don’t want to cook after a long day.

On top of that, cleaning of the shared spaces, building maintenance, garbage disposal and various condo amenities are provided to you, all within a short reach. Security is another big benefit of living in a condo that most people overlook. Compared to houses and townhouses where you park your car outside, most condo residents own a parking spot that’s indoor and also have a concierge that patrols the building 24/7.Condo units also have some downsides. They tend to be smaller than other types of residential buildings and all the amenities and convenience come with a higher monthly cost. Grocery shopping can also be a hassle as you have to wait for the residents shared elevators. Townhouse A townhouse is a hybrid of a condo and a house. Townhouses usually come bigger than condos and they have lower management costs. Still, townhouses share several walls with neighbors so there might be some noises that you wouldn’t get in a house. On the flip side, townhouses share some of the same benefits of houses. When you open your door, the first thing that’s going to greet you is your lawn and the open sky. And you’ll better appreciate our autumn and long winter when you don’t have to clean leaves and shovel snow.

## House

Houses have the biggest living space out of the three residential types mentioned here. The clear separation between you and your neighbors means less noise to worry about. Also, aside from getting the right permits, because the land that your house sits on is yours, there’s a lot of freedom as to what you do with this space. Have you been thinking of putting up a sweet deck for the perfect summer BBQ? Living in a house will let you do that. More ways to decorate and living by your own lifestyle means you have to do all these things yourself. So if you’re a dreamer and not necessarily a doer (and you don’t feel like opening your wallet to hire professionals), we recommend that you settle by going with a townhouse. Most houses are located in suburban areas, so if your work is located in downtown, you would have to consider driving or dealing with the dreadful morning and evening commute. Despite the downsides, we still think that living in a house is a Canadian dream. Canada is known for its clean air, beautiful nature and enjoying life outdoors. If this the lifestyle that you’re craving, what’s raking some leaves and shoveling snow to you? And yes, we know that at the end of the day, your budget will have the biggest influence on what you choose (with a majority of first-time home buyers choosing a small condo). However, if you’re looking to make some sacrifice with location, there may be some hidden options that we can help you find. Send us a message today to not miss what you could’ve found!
