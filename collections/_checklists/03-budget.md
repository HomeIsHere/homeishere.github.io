Before you set out to purchase a home, it’s important to figure out how much savings you can use towards the purchase, *and* if you are thinking of getting a mortgage, how much of your after-tax salary you can set aside to cover the principal and interest. Most people only focus on the first part, but it’s usually the second part that catches people off guard.



The lump payment that you make with your savings (usually around 15~20%) is fixed. So there’s a clear ceiling as to what your prospective home should be priced at. With a mortgage, you pay it over many years so the monthly obligation that is reasonable today may not be the case in the near future.



Here are a few things that you should know to comfortably afford your new home.



## How much down payment can you afford?

For an uninsured mortgage, you need to have at least 20% of the home price as the down payment. Because it’s uninsured, you don’t have to pay an insurance premium to CMHC. Being uninsured sounds bad, but it just means that because you’re taking less loan out, you’re less risky on defaulting (which CMHC covers with the premium on a higher-than-80% mortgage that you take out).



The lower your down payment, the less choice you have in what home you can purchase. It varies person to person, but usually, you can get between 4 to 4.5 times more than your salary for a mortgage. If your annual salary is $80,000, your bank will give you somewhere between $320,000 and $360,000. Increasing your salary is outside of your control. However, determining how much you are going to spend and how much you’re going to save is well within your power. Yes, we understand that it’s hard for young people early in their career to further reduce their essential expenses, but forgoing those extra cups of coffee and taking the dreadful TTC instead of Uber will truly matter in the long run.



You can also use your RRSP for a down payment. The Government of Canada allows first-time home buyers to take out up to $35,000 from their RRSP to cover a portion of a down payment (for a couple, it’s up to $70,000). Using it for a down payment exempts you from paying the early withdrawal penalty, but you need to deposit the same amount to your RRSP account within 15 years. Your RRSP account must have been opened at least 90 days before you withdraw it.



## Understanding your future cashflow and recurring expenses

To be prepared to make your monthly mortgage obligations, you must be able to handle changes in your income and expenses in the future. Some of your key one-time and recurring expenses are as follow:

- Your after-tax income subtracted by major recurring expenses such as automobile lease/finance payments, gas, internet, utilities and grocery bills
- Monthly mortgage payments (principal + interest), property management fee, and insurance
- Entertainment (everyone needs an occasional night off)
- Expenses associated with closing (approximately 3~5% of the property value)



You also need to consider if you are expecting a major event that’s going to either decrease your income or increase your expenses. If you drive an aged car and you’re considering getting a new one, that’s an additional lease/finance cost. If you are expecting a baby and you need to take additional time off, that’s going to put a dent on your cashflow.



Before you set out to set the filter on the home price range, you need to first take a long hard look at how much you’ve saved, your current income and expenses and incoming major events. The rule of thumb is not spending more than 30% of your salary on housing-related cost.
