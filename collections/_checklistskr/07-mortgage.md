In this article, we will introduce some of common financial measures used by banks or mortgage lenders to calculate the maximum amount they can lend to a borrower.

1. GDS (Gross Debt Service Ratio) -

GDS (a/b) is calculated by dividing the monthly payment amounts associated with housing costs (a) including mortgage payments, utilities, property maintenance fees and taxes by his/her gross income (b). In general, it is considered a high risk to allocation more than 30%~32% of your gross income towards monthly housing payments.

2. TDS (Total Debt Service Ratio)
TDS considers not only mortgage payments but also all other payments associated with any type of debts. Theses may include unpaid credit card transactions and auto loans. The percentage of monthly payments associated with total debts over gross income is used to determine the affordability of a borrower. Though it varies between lenders, a ratio above 40% is considered high.

Example
Consider a borrower with a gross monthly income of $6,000. In order to be considered ‘safe’ for mortgage, the total monthly payments associated with all debts should be below $6,000 x 40% = $2,400 to keep TDS below 40%.
Now suppose the borrower’s fixed debt payments include $200 for an auto loan, $200 for OSAP, and $500 for credit cars per month. Lenders would recommend the borrower to keep the total monthly housing costs including mortgage payments below $1,500.
