question: Who qualifies for FTHBI?
---
<p>In order for you to be qualified for FTHBI, you must satisfy all of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You must be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or a non-permanent resident who is legally authorized to work in Canada.</li>
    <li>You have never purchased a home (either as an investment or to live in it).</li>
    <li>If you have purchased a home to live in it, it was 4 years ago.</li>
    <li>You have recently gone through a breakdown of a marriage or common-law partnership. In this case, you are still eligible even if you donâ€™t meet other requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another very important point is that you cannot use FTHBI to buy an investment property. That means, once the home is ready to be occupied, it is you and your spouse who move in to live in it.</p>
