question: How do I calculate the maximum price I can afford with FTHBI?
---
<p>The home you can afford is largely dependent on two factors: you and your spouse’s combined income and down payment size. Your mortgage + incentive is 4 times the combined income. This amount covers between 85.01% to 90.01% of the home price depending on whether you’re buying an existing home or a new home. This means that you’re responsible for either 14.99% (existing home) or 9.99% (new home) remaining down payment.</p>
<p>So here are two quick formulas you can use to calculate the maximum price you can afford:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Existing Home</strong>

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>New Development</strong>
        <div>formula here</div>
    </li>
</ul>
