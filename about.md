# About Us

We provide end-to-end services in your home buying journey by first understanding your goal and situation, analyzing market conditions, narrowing down neighbourhoods and desired homes, and guiding you through the complicated admin process and finding various government incentives that you’re eligible for.

Everyone on our team has gone through step one of buying a home – talking to various real estate agents. This is the stage where all realtors claim that they can get the best condo units at the VVIP stage, how they have exclusive perks promised by the builder, and how every home in their inventory is a must-buy, high-prospect property for both end users and investors. We encourage you to compare our insights and approach with what you’ll commonly hear from other agents.

We’ll tell you what the data tells us, what we find out after talking to government officials, 3rd-party analysis from major agencies in Canada, and what our conclusions say after going through rigorous analyses.

# Meet the Team {#meet-the-team}

We are a five-person team with a deep interest in working with data. We’re not saying that just because “data” is today’s hottest buzzword; our professional backgrounds are a testament to how closely we work with data and what got us started with this project.

The team includes the head of digital strategy at a Fortune 50 tech company, a credit risk expert at one of the Big Five banks in Canada, a financial analyst at a multi-billion dollar franchise business, a PhD candidate in statistics at a top-ranked university in Canada, and finally, an experienced Canadian realtor.

Today’s home buyers are smarter than ever, armed with information available online and quick to hear the latest news on the market. The type of consultation that you want is based on facts, real and recent data, and critical insights that we are confident that we are uniquely positioned to provide to you.

The biggest decision in your life shouldn’t be based on what you want to hear, but based on what you need to hear. Your dream home is out there – and we think you can find it better with us.
